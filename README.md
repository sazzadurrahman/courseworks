# Courseworks

# 1. Analytics_Machine_Learning: 
SVM and Logistic Reegression Machine Learning models are used to identify whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.
The dataset used here taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/, which describes different species of mushrooms from the genera Agaricus and Lepiota.

# 2. Autism_Classification: 
It analyses data to determine whether a patient has ASD or not

# 3. Databricks_Climate_Data: 
It analyses climate data (open data used from the World Bank) in Databricks on AWS

# 4. Neural_Network: 
It uses MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits by implementing two hidden layers in Neural Network

# 5. Record_Match: 
It uses RecordLinkage to match records among difference sources
